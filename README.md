The calculator application includes fundamental arithmetic functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, implemented in a structured and modular way. Edge cases, such as division by zero and handling of negative values, are thoroughly tested to maintain high standards of reliability and performance.

Tools and Frameworks
Language
C#: The primary programming language used for implementing the calculator logic and creating the test suite. The application follows object-oriented principles, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

Testing Framework
NUnit: An open-source testing framework for C# that is used to design and execute the unit tests in this project. NUnit offers robust features for data-driven tests, including [TestCase] and [TestCaseSource] annotations, which allow for parameterized testing and edge case validation.

IDE
Visual Studio :  IDE offers seamless integration with NUnit, allowing for easy test execution, debugging, and code inspection.
